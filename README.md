# proxy-pantheon-directories
for offloading requests from archived directories via php 

The intention of this script is to provide Pantheon users a method of offloading files via PHP. I've designed it so that you can modify / add CORS, to control where requests are coming through. Alternatively, you can set none, and let the client cache the request.
